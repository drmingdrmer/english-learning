# Why are INTPs so bad at strategy (compared to INTJs) and does this reflect negatively on their intelligence?

I love my INTP friends. They are the most book intelligent of the types. It's a kind of rarified intelligence though. They're clever, but more awkward than INTJs, even, when it comes to socially.

I hope they'll forgive me by saying that INTPs don't do “strategy” they do “fantasy.” They, more or less, live and thrive one arm's length away from the real world. They are really good at visualizing different (theoretical) maps of reality. They can be artists, musicians and storytellers. When they tinker and invent, they do so with their mind's eye first. They don't always see the fruits of their intellectual labors through to reality, or even care to; it was enough to have imagined it.

Tesla and Einstein were INTPs. Some of our greatest medical, societal advancements have come from them. I love me some INTPs. That's why they let themselves get overtaken by bankers.

An INTJ is highly theoretical too, but they really want to see the theory put into action. They really want to see it applied to reality. Until it is satisfactorily applied, it’s just “fake news.” And their success or failure to do so will either establish the theory as fact or disconfirm the theory altogether.

INTJs are the best strategists, as a class. ENTJs and INFJs are close seconds but they aren't nearly as long term minded as INTJs.
