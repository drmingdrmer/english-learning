“Mom, can I play Minecraft?”

The afternoon was unscheduled, open, gloriously free. I had no reason to tell my son no. But I didn’t want to say yes. We’d just been up on the little ski mountain that sits above our town, indulging in a skip-school ski day with my father.

If the mountain had been foggy, which can cause disorientation and sometimes severe vertigo, or if the snow had been sticky or icy, or if it had been windy, the snow cutting our faces like needles, or if my son had fallen down hard and badly, then soothing the afternoon with an hour or so of Minecraft would have made sense.

But none of those things were true. It had, in fact, been one of the most perfect days I had ever experienced. It had snowed all morning but not hard. There was no fog, a rare thing on our lake-adjacent ski hill.

The light was like nothing I’d ever seen before. A cloud inversion lay below us, smothering the valley, but up high the sky was clear and the sun bright. A ray of light that glowed without fading, like a ground-level sundog, followed us all over the mountain. Looking through it, we could see every particle of snow as it flashed through the light. A sublime day, a day the gothic architect Augustus Pugin might have gloried in — the snow soft, the horizon sharp, the temperature cold but not biting, the air rich with the scent of altitude and snow, and the sky full of diamonds.

We’d stopped a lot, more often than we usually do, to marvel at the air, the light, the ridiculously transcendent beauty of the day. More than anything I wanted to stay up there just to walk around and wonder at one of the most beautiful horizons I’d ever seen.

Icame home with a feeling that is familiar in my Rocky Mountain homeland, but that I don’t savor nearly often enough — the feeling I get from listening to the silence deep in a lodgepole pine forest, from standing on a ridgeline looking out into millions of acres of wilderness, from camping by some high mountain lake I don’t even know the name of, or from waking in the middle of the night to stare up at the raw starlight of the Milky Way.

It’s more than a connection to nature. It’s a feeling of being tremendously alive, present, a conscious creature able to appreciate not just the beauty of the natural world, but our own miraculous existence within it.

My family spends enough energy struggling with the balance of screen time that I knew what turning on my son’s iPad would do, how it would diminish that feeling, erase the physical delight of our tired bodies, make the memory of that diamond-shot daylight fade.

“Think about the day we just had, how beautiful it was,” I told him. “Think about how happy you feel right now. The thing is, if you go on your screen, that feeling might all kind of go away. You can if you want, but think about it.” He thought about it for a bit, and then decided to play with Legos. I took my own advice and turned away from the siren call of my inbox, spending the remainder of the afternoon working offline. I felt enriched, like I’d taken a hit of pure oxygen.

Far too few of us have the luxury of time or access to nature to even consider these kinds of choices. The simple act of immersing oneself in nature, in trees and quiet and the shifting light, shouldn’t have to be for the privileged. We need access to nature for our physical health and our mental well-being; more than ever, we need it to counter the increasing digitization of our lives and relationships.

Humans’ need for nature is still a new field of study, despite the success of Richard Louv’s 2008 book *Last Child in the Woods*, and Florence Williams’s more recent book *The Nature Fix*. But the evidence of nature’s importance to our happiness and health continues to accumulate.

A [2014 study in Wisconsin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24662966/), which used a large population sample and swathes of land ranging from urban to rural, found that having access to green spaces significantly decreased rates of depression, anxiety, and stress. Living in a neighborhood full of trees, the researchers found, had a larger impact on depressive symptoms than access to health insurance.

This followed on a 2008 study in England, which focused on the link between physical health, poverty, and access to green spaces. [Simply living near green spaces, the researchers from the University of Glasgow found, reduced mortality rates in low-income neighbourhoods, especially for circulatory system- and heart-related illnesses](https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/archiveofnews/2008/november/headline_97505_en.html).

A number of studies have shown that [just walking to school, especially in an environment that includes nature (trees, woods, or parks) increases children’s concentration and reduces their stress](https://sciencenordic.com/children-and-adolescents-denmark-exercise/children-who-walk-to-school-concentrate-better/1379550). This is especially true for children diagnosed with attention-deficit disorders, which Williams chronicled in *The Nature Fix*. Nature, several studies have shown, draws our attention, but [in a bottom-up manner that is restorative and restful, whereas the kinds of attention we give to motorized cityscapes is top-down, demanding and exhausting](https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/97954841/The_impact_of_walking_in_different_urban_environments_on_brain_activity_in_older_people.pdf). Research on attention given to the digital environment will likely find even more exhaustive demands.

Studies like these make visible what we’ve previously either ignored or repressed. Moving through nature under our own steam is a vital component of human health. Walking and exposure to nature are deeply linked, creating feedback loops of stress reduction, exercise, meditative states, cardiovascular health, and improved mood.

In order to receive the benefits of nature, we have to remember that we are also part of it, which means we have to move through it at a human pace — that is, on our feet, not in a car.

The point where the wild becomes artifice isn’t neatly defined. A stick made into a lever, an animal transformed into food, tools, and shelter; a plant turned into medicine, a chemical forced into new bonds that open up a world of plastics; a moccasin made out of hide, a running shoe made from a collection of bright, rarely-recyclable materials; a pair of eyeglasses, a virtual reality headset; a wooden water-wheel in a small stream, a concrete dam a mile high that blocks a river and drains a country dry.

All of these things are human-made, all of them manufactured. We continue to ask the wrong questions about the natural, or wild, world, versus the human-made one. What we should be asking is: which human-made things allow us to be most fully part of the wild? How can we walk, eat, bear children, learn to read and write, build community, watch Netflix, and still have a wilderness that thrives inside all of us and honors the wild without?

(Maybe we’ll have to do without the Netflix.)

In accepting all artifice, all technology, as equal, we not only destroy ecosystems, we also destroy the wild within us, that which finds solace and joy in mountain vistas, in the rustling of trees, in the pleasure of bare feet pressed upon summer clover, in a hug, or in the child’s thrill of stamping in a rain puddle — that part of us that knows we’re animals evolved on a planet whose air, water, microbes, atmosphere, and gravity are as fundamental to our humanity as the faculty of reason.

What are we but wild? No amount of technology will ever free us from the reality of our interdependence with all other life. Even if you pursued the immortality dreams of certain Silicon Valley investors and downloaded your mind onto a computer, jettisoning your mortal body, that computer would still need energy, materials, and maintenance, all of which are part of life, come from life, depend on life. There is no living without other life, no escape to some universe where you can finally be free of interconnection, no existence without the wild.

The effects of nature, especially of walking in nature, have been obvious to me from my earliest mothering years, even before I started coming across research. When my kids were little and were prone to long, intense tantrums, the effect on them — and me, whose patience was always worn bare by midmorning — of simply stepping outside was so profound it was almost cliché. Inside the house, our senses folded in on themselves, winding tighter as the walls and lights and ceiling created a sensory battle and a need for escape. The space was too small for what we were feeling. We’d step outside, and all those irritated nerves spooled out, stretching and easing in response to the rustling trees, the sight of red-winged blackbirds or frost-covered swamp grasses, the scent of green growing things or the snap of snow in the air, the open sky.

Much as I love skiing, I’m under no illusions about the skip-school ski day I had with my father and son. Skiing is unlikely to exist for much more of my life as our winters start later and shift into rain, not to mention the sport’s own significant carbon footprint. The snow itself was almost certainly riddled with the [microplastics that have been detected in rain, and are likely in the snow, too, throughout the Rocky Mountains](https://www.sciencealert.com/us-geological-survey-finds-it-s-raining-plastic-in-the-rocky-mountains).

But that richness that we came home with, the fulfilment, the satisfaction that no other experience can replace — it’s a reminder of what is possible.

Instead of damping experiences of our co-evolved natural world with the digital one so ready to entertain or enrage, we could walk out into a sunlit day where the air is full of diamonds, and carry that giddy lightness within us until it begins to fade of its own accord. We could be wild again.
